            <div className='heading'>PLAGIARISM POLICY</div>
            Plagiarism is copying someone else's previous ideas, processes, results, or words without giving credit to the original author and source. It is a serious academic misconduct that undermines the principles of integrity, honesty, and intellectual rigor in scholarly endeavors. Someone commits plagiarism when they intentionally or knowingly replicate the work of others, or when they reproduce content without giving proper credit.<br /><br />If plagiarism is detected by the editorial board member, reviewer, editor etc., in any stage of article process- before or after acceptance, during editing or at a page proof stage. We will alert the same to the author(s) and will ask them to rewrite the content or to cite the references from where the content has been taken. If more than 10% of the paper is plagiarized- the article will be rejected and the same is notified to the author. the tunitin siftware is used to check the plagiarism percentge of both web and AI.<br /><br />In case a manuscript is found to be plagiarized after publication, the Editor-in-Chief will conduct preliminary investigation, may be with the help of a suitable committee constituted for the purpose. If the manuscript is found to be plagiarized beyond the acceptable limits, the journal will contact the author’s Institute / College / University and Funding Agency, if any.<br /><br />
            <div className='span'>The following types of plagiarism are considered by us:</div>
            <br />
            <b>1. Full Plagiarism:</b>
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously published content without any changes to the text, idea and grammar is considered as full plagiarism. It involves presenting exact text from a source as one’s own
            <br /><br />
            <b>2. Partial Plagiarism:</b>
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If content is a mixture from multiple different sources, where the author has extensively rephrased text, then it is known as partial plagiarism.
            <br /><br />
            <b>3. Self-Plagiarism:</b>
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an author reuses complete or portions of their pre-published research, then it is known as self-plagiarism. Complete self-plagiarism is a case when an author republishes their own previously published work in a new journal.
            <br /><br /><b>AI-Generated Research Content:</b>
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plagiarism involves the dishonest practice of utilizing another person's work or thoughts without acknowledging the source. Although AI writing programs can produce text that is indistinguishable from that written by humans, they lack the capability to independently carry out research, develop unique concepts, or derive significant insights. Depending exclusively on AI for research paper creation brings up issues regarding the genuineness and inventiveness of the work. Therefore, any manuscript generated entirely or partially using AI tools without proper human oversight, critical analysis, and citation of sources will be considered a violation of ethical research practices.
